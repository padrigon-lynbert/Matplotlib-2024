# Matplotpib - Q1 2024
Even though I'm sure it's only the fundamentals, I learnt a lot in this course and I'm making use of it to get my foot in the door. Finally completed -- numpy, pandas and matplotlib, my first core libraries for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

It's not that difficult to understand; in fact, perhaps my previous library experience really helped.

Primarily just matplotlib doing its thing and charting data around, with the occasional surprise or use of pandas or basic numpy techniques for reading data. Most likely the reason it's simple is that we don't deal with data very oftenâ€”most of the time, it's provided and pre-structured for its intended use. <br> <br>

I have included a few graphs below to offer you with a brief summary of the situation, but it is evident from some of them that there is no context at all, demonstrating my complete lack of knowledge with data.

And that's it. I believe I'm prepared to delve further into machine learning, data science, finance, or whatever related fields since I'm a champion and I'm undefeated this jungle is mine now and I'm going to create my kingdom some mines and things with cheap labors from the monkeys and fishes. Elon Musk must be looking for me.
